      <p class="detail"><b>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</b> (Bengali: শেখ মুজিবুর রহমান; 17 March 1920 – 15 August 1975), often
        shortened as Sheikh Mujib or Mujib and widely known as Bangabandhu was a Bangladeshi politician, statesman and
        Founding Father of Bangladesh who served as the first President and later as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh
        from April 1971 until his assassination in August 1975.[1] Mujib is credited with leading the successful
        campaign for Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan. He is revered in Bangladesh with the honourific title of
        "Bangabandhu" (Bôngobondhu "Friend of Bengal") which is used around the world. He was a founding member and
        eventual leader of the Awami League, founded in 1949 as an East Pakistan–based political party in Pakistan.
        Mujib is considered to have been a fundamental figure in the efforts to gain political autonomy for East
        Pakistan and later as the central figure behind the Bangladesh Liberation Movement and the Bangladesh Liberation
        War in 1971. Thus, he is regarded as the "Jatir Janak" or "Jatir Pita" (Jatir Jônok or Jatir Pita, both meaning
        "Father of the Nation") of Bangladesh. His daughter Sheikh Hasina is the current leader of the Awami League and
        currently serves as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

          <li> The constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true sense on the Lahore Resolution

            the universal adult franchise.</li>
          <li>The federal government should deal with only two subjects: defense and foreign affairs, and all other
            residuary subjects shall be vested in the federating states.</li>

          <li> Two separate, but freely convertible currencies for two wings should be introduced; or if this is not
            feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should
            be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate banking
            reserve should be established and separate fiscal and monetary policy be adopted for East Pakistan.</li>
          <li> The power of taxation and revenue collection shall be vested in the federating units and the federal
            center will have no such power. The Federation will be entitled to a share in the state taxes to meet its
            expenditures.</li>
          <li>There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange earnings of the two wings; the foreign
            exchange requirements of the federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a ratio to be
            fixed; indigenous products should move free of duty between the two wings, and the constitution should
            empower the units to establish trade links with foreign countries.</li>
